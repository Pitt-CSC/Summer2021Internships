# Contributing to the Internship List
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Pitt CSC and Simplify internship list!

Below, you'll find the guidelines for our repository. If you have any questions, please create a [miscellaneous issue](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2024-Internships/issues/new/choose).

## Finding an Internship to Add
We ask that the internships that you add meet some requirements. Specifically, your internship must
- be in one of the following categories:
    - software/computer engineering
    - computer/data science
    - product management
    - quant
    - any other tech-related internships
- be located in the United States, Canada, or remote.
- not already exist in the internship list.

## Adding an Internship
Cool! You're ready to add an internship to the list. Follow these steps:

1) First create a new issue [here](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2024-Internships/issues/new/choose).
2) Select the **New Internship** issue template.
3) Fill in the information about your internship into the form, then hit submit.
> Please make a new submission for each unique position, **even if they are for the same company**.
4) That's it! Once a member of our team has reviewed your submission, it will be automatically added to the correct `README`

## Editing an Internship
To edit an internship (changing links, setting as inactive, changing start date, etc.), follow these steps:
1) First copy the url of the internship you would like to edit.
> This can be found by right-clicking on the `APPLY` button and selecting **copy link address**
2) Create a new issue [here](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2024-Internships/issues/new/choose).
3) Select the **Edit Internship** issue template.
4) Fill in the url to the **link** input.
> This is how we ensure your edit affects the correct internship
5) Leave every field blank except for whichever fields you would like to update or change about the internship.
6) If it is not obvious why you are making the change, please specify why in the reason box at the bottom of the form.
7) Hit submit. A member of our team will review your revision and approve it shortly.

## Deleting an Internship
It is preferable to set an internship as inactive (see [Editing an Internship](#Editing-an-Internship) above) rather than deleting it.

However, if an internship is fake, does not fit the theme of the repo, or is offensive, follow the instructions for [Editing an Internship](#Editing-an-Internship) and check the box next to **Yes, remove this internship**

## Automatic README.md Updates
A script will automatically add new contributions as well as new internships found by [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs) to the appropriate README. The row will look something like this:
```md
| Company | Role | Location | Link | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| **[Example Company](https://link.to/company)** | Software Engineering Internship Example | San Francisco, CA | <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5JF7mJI.png" width="150" alt="Apply"> | ✅ |
```

When rendered, it will look like:
| Company | Role | Location | Link | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| **[Example Company]()** | Software Engineering Internship Example | San Francisco, CA | <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5JF7mJI.png" width="150" alt="Apply"> | ✅ |
